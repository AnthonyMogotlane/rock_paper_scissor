Things to do:
1. Work on the js file!
   - The playGame function needs logic
     that will dertimine, who won and then
     assign the winner to the winner variable

2. After the first step is done the code should work
   I have set things up nicely so that everything works
   as expected, if not then you can debug it.

How the game works:
1. A player clicks on either Rock, Paper, Scissors
   and then the JavaScript code runs on the back ground to decide who won.
2. The player will be playing against the computer.
3. The player can play as many times as he wants

Extra:
1. Create a button that will reset the winner text (Is it nessecary?)

Might have accidentally gone overkill with this [LukhanyoV]
